# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this report is to provide an analysis of the School District's performance, with the exception of the ninth graders that attend Thomas High School due to alleged academic dishonesty. The school board advised that the current data shows evidence of possible grade alterations; in order to uphold state-testing standards, it was advised to replaced both math and reading scores with the NaN value and proceed with the reporting. The analysis will include data before and after the adjustment to compare and contrast the results of the allegations.

- The removal of the grades, of course didn't affect the budget for the school but the more micro portion of the report, without a disclosing the single High School's grade removal could present some confusion and possibly an ill advised decision regarding cut-backs to the budget.
- There was a slight decrease in the average Math score, by a tenth of a percent.
- For the average Reading score, there was no change; more than likely there was an even pool and not a significant standard deviation in grades that were removed.
- When it comes to the percentages, there was more noticable affect; to the extent of two-tenths of a percent and three-tenths of a percent in the percentage of student who passed math and reading, respectively. Thats simply because the student population doesn't change when determining these figures.
- Subsequently, this affects the "percentage overall passing" figure, which is derived from the percentage of students who pass math and reading.
